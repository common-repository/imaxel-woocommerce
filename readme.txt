== Description ==
**EDITOR FOR PERSONALIZATION OF PRINTED PRODUCTS**

This plugin connects your Woocommerce with Imaxel's HTML5 personalization editors. You can offer personalized products on your website: photo books, photo albums, photography, enlargements, mugs, cushions, calendars, cards, greeting cards, posters, banners, t-shirts, rollups, canvases, collages, methacrylates, aluminum, blackboards, catalogs, invitations, merchandising, decoration, textiles, large format and almost any product that you can personalize and print.

The editors include a complete system that covers the entire personalization + sale + printing process. All this integrated into the business cycle of your Woocommerce.

**MAIN ADVANTAGES**

- You as a merchant can use the standard products that are already included, or create and offer your own exclusive products and designs.

- Merchant manages the printing and manufacturing. The system automatically downloads ready-to-print files to the merchant's production center. No need to modify the files or do prepress manipulations.

- Merchant receives ready-to-print files in PDF or JPEG format, which can be directly connected to print servers and printers from Fujifilm, DNP, Citizen, Mitsubishi, Noritsu, EPSON.

- Plugin does not affect the performance of your website. The entire process of uploading images, editing, rendering and downloading is done within the Imaxel platform on AWS, prepared to handle thousands of requests per day.

**HOW TO INTEGRATE PERSONALIZATION EDITORS:**

- Before configuring the system, Merchant has to contract its account and a usage plan with Imaxel. There is a free trial plan. Then the cost of the platform is variable depending on the use you make. There are very affordable plans for entrepreneurs who are starting out, and also special prices for businesses that have a high daily orders volume.

- The plugin by itself will not be useful until the merchant has an Imaxel account. When contracting the service, Imaxel will provide the Merchant with instructions and the keys for the installation and creation of personalized products.

**HOW THE EDITOR PLUGIN WORKS WITHIN WORDPRESS**

- The plugin allows users to create a new type of product in WooCommerce called “personalizable”. This new type of product is compatible with the rest of the products in WooCommerce, so merchants can sell personalized and non-personalized  products simultaneously.

- In "customizable" products, the "buy" button is replaced by the "create" button, which adds the intermediate personalization process before the product is added to the cart.

- Pressing "create" opens a screen with the editor so that the consumer can edit the product: choose designs, upload photos, add texts and add cliparts.

- The consumer visualizes how his product will look once personalized (WYSIWYG: what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and if he is satisfied, he can add it to the WooCommerce shopping cart.

- When the consumer makes the payment in WooCommerce, the plugin confirms the design and the Imaxel personalization system automatically launches the preparation process. The merchant receives the files ready to print in a few seconds.
